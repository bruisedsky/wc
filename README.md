# wc - world computer

wc is a simulation of what it might be like to be an AI in a socially diverse city. 
agents will permutate component parts to find the most successful traits based on
a emergent social heirarchey and system of reward.

inital design will be a text based mud with a queable turn based game loop (limited gui/graphics)
all game world mechanics will be at least based on simple (not deep) neural networks
more advanced unsupervised methods may (and should) be employed as interesting opportuinities arise

inital entities will be "mirror" of each mind/body pair.
other "components" will be added as the complexity of existing componenets are balanced.
