# wc - water closet simulator

wc is an advanced simulation of what it might be like to live in a toilet, like.. umm.. seattle.

the goal? prove me wrong!

inital design will be a text based mud with a queable limited turn based game loop (no gui/graphics)
all game world mechanics will be atleast based on simple (not deep) neural networks
more advanced unsupervised methods may (and should) be employed as interesting opportuinities arise

inital entieies will be "mirror" of each human player character,
other "components" will be added as the complexity of existing componenets are balanced.
